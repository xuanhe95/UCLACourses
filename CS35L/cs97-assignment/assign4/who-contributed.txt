I used the following command to search for the specific sentence.

git log --source -S 'Even newspaper reports present contradictory information' --all

It shows the following outputs:

    Eggert changes
    
    SCCS-file: northamerica
    SCCS-SID: 7.20

This means that this sentence's author is Arthur David Olson,
and Eggert made this commits.


I also use grep -r "Even newspaper" * 
to try to find the sentence.
It is locate at northamerica line 890

#Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
#and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information"

Since it states that the sentence is  said by Shanks (well, it is quoted)
i think the copyright issue would be fine?
